This is my senior honors thesis examining urban heat distributions across Chapel Hill, NC. The Data-Driven EnviroLab asked volunteers to walk through pre-designed routes and use sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, and heat index across various parts of Chapel Hill. I analyzed these data using various programming skills and extracted insights on the distribution of urban heat in the Town. I also analyzed socioeconomic disparities in urban heat distributions, using data from the CDC Social Vulnerability Index.
