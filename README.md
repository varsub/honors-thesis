This repo contains all the code I wrote for my senior honors thesis examining urban heat distributions across Chapel Hill, NC.

For this project, the Data-Driven EnviroLab (DDL) asked volunteers to walk through pre-designed routes and use sensors to collect data on temperature, humidity, and heat index across various parts of Chapel Hill. I then individually analyzed these data using various programming languages and extracted insights on the distribution of urban heat in the Town. I also analyzed socioeconomic disparities in urban heat distributions, using data from the CDC Social Vulnerability Index.
